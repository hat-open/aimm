Contributing
============

Welcome to the contributing guidelines for the AIMM project. This document is
intended for new contributors, to get acquainted with the contribution
procedures.

This project is in early stages of development, with no exact functional
specification (i.e., the current specification might be subject to changes).
For this reason, pull requests are discouraged at this moment. 

Bug reports may be created using GitHub's issue tracker. However, the same
warning as above applies, the issues might be declined.

The issue tracker may also be used to ask questions about the project or
suggest changes/new features. We will look into these and add them to our
milestones, if accepted. Feel free to create a suggestion issue. The discussion
is currently imagined to be in free-form, not enforcing any templates.
