REPL
====

REPL client is a Python library that communicates with the :doc:`REPL control
<../../server/control/repl>` and provides an interface that triggers
interactions with it. Its intended purpose is to be imported and used in REPL
environment, but there are no real restrictions on it being used as a library.
While client implementation is contained within the ``aimm.client.repl``
module, which is specified hereafter.
